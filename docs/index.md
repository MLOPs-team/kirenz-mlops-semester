## Data Architecture & MLOps
test1234

This is the documentation for our project. At the moment there is only one index.md file that will be expanded. Later on we want to introduce different pages. 

During this project we want to apply a sample use case using the following structure to run an MLOps Process-Lifecycle

### Our example use case



### Data

### Delta Lake

Using Delta Lake you can build a lakehouse architecture. A lakehouse can be used to build a platform that combines Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics. As this [paper](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf) says: "the data warehouse architecture as we know
it today will wither in the coming years and be replaced by a new
architectural pattern, the Lakehouse,". 

#### What is Apache Spark (and PySpark)

PySpark is a Python API that can be used to access Apache Spark. There are other Libraries available for other programming languages like Java for example.
